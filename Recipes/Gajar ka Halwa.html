    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>This Punjabi dessert is subtle and divine without being super sweet, unlike most North Indian mithais or desserts. Almost a zen-like process, making gajar ka halwa is a labor of love; donâ€™t rush. Enjoy the process. It will be worth it!</p>
      <p>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 to 6 tablespoons ghee</li>
        <li>1/3 cup nuts, such as pistachios, almonds or cashews, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds carrot (about 8 carrots), peeled and coarsely grated on the large holes of a box grate</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds, crushed, optional</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar, plus more if needed</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring the milk to boil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, stirring often to keep the milk from burning. Reduce the heat enough to keep the milk in a low boil, and cook, stirring frequently, until the milk is reduced to about 1 1/2 to 2 cups, about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon ghee in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the nuts and cook, stirring, until golden and crunchy, about 2 minutes; remove to a paper towel and set aside.</li>
      <li>In the same skillet, add the carrots and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the carrots soften and dry up a little, about 15 minutes. If the carrots start sticking, add 1 tablespoon ghee.  </li>
      <li>Add the reduced milk and cardamom if using and increase the heat to medium-high. Mix well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat a touch to maintain a heavy simmer, stirring regularly, until the milk is completely absorbed by the carrots, about 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Add the sugar and cook, stirring regularly, until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Taste and add more sugar if needed. Remove and discard the cardamom seeds if desired. </li>
      <li>If serving right away, add 3 tablespoons of ghee and cook, stirring, until the halwa starts pulling away from the side of the pan and is a little caramelized, about 10 minutes. Garnish with nuts before serving. </li>
      <li>Ideally, you should make the halwa earlier in the day or the day before. Just before serving, heat some ghee in a wok or large skillet (in India they would do it in a kadhai), add some of the halwa (just as much as you want to eat) and cook, stirring, until somewhat caramelized and a little crunchy. Garnish with the nuts and serve.</li>
